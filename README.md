# Custom_LED_Speakers

This is a WIP (Work in Progress). Many features to be added. Im updating as im going along. also, nothing is tested yet, so if you would make something like this, and use my code, I dont promis anything at the moment. Until the testing rig is finished, I'll just say, this is WIP and anything and nothing can work!



If you want to have custom DIY lighting in your speakers, controlled by an Arduino, this project might be worth a look.

Spin and flash-to-the-beat
