# Custom_LED_Speakers

This is a WIP (Work in Progress). Many features to be added. Im updating as im going along



If you want to have custom DIY lighting in your speakers, controlled by an Arduino, this project might be worth a look.

Features

造 Multiple effects, for now:
Spin and flash-to-the-beat



Planned Features

造 Atleast two more effects

造 Switching between effects

造 Support for manual control over fans, and autoswitching between manual / auto (probably not PWM)
