# ControlLED (Arduino Part)

!!!This is a WIP (Work in Progress). Im updating as im going along. also, nothing is tested yet, so if you would make something like this, and use my code, I dont promis anything at the moment. Until the testing rig is finished, I'll just say, this is WIP and anything and nothing can work!

If you want to have custom DIY lighting in your speakers, controlled by an Arduino, this project might be worth a look. This code will allow you to control your speaker RGB LEDs over Bluetooth, and get some nice effect for them.


Features

¤ Individually select different LED colors
¤ Multiple effects to choose from
¤ Switching between effects via both bluetooth and manual
¤ Manual control over the fans
¤ Fans controlled by temperature readings
¤ Autoswitching between manual / auto

The Fans are controlled via PWM. 

The effects are hardcoded into the arduino, and are the following: Spin, Flash to music, and Random


Below is a example of how it's going to look when finished. All the white boxes are components located under the floor.

 A more detailed diagram of how to wire this thing up will come when it is released.
