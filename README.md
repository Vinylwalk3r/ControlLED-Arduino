# Custom_LED_Speakers

This is a WIP (Work in Progress). Im updating as im going along. also, nothing is tested yet, so if you would make something like this, and use my code, I dont promis anything at the moment. Until the testing rig is finished, I'll just say, this is WIP and anything and nothing can work!



If you want to have custom DIY lighting in your speakers, controlled by an Arduino, this project might be worth a look. This code will allow you to control your speaker RGB LEDs over Bluetooth, and get some nice effect for them.


Features

造 Multiple effects, for now:
Spin, Random and Flash-to-music

造 Switching between effects

造 Support for manual control over fans, and autoswitching between manual / auto (PWM)

造 In auto, fans are controlled by temperature. Manual is manual.
